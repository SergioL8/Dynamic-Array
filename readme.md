# Covid cases tracker - Dynamic Array

## Description
This project is a fully functional storage system for tracking COVID-19 cases during the pandemic. The goal was to develop a system in C++ capable of handling an indefinite number of COVID-19 case records, providing efficient and quick access to stored data.


## Key features
The core feature of this project is the implementation of a dynamic array. Standard arrays in C++ have a fixed size, which is often impractical for situations where the required storage capacity is unpredictable, such as during a pandemic where cases can escalate into millions. Dynamic arrays are especially useful in these scenarios for their ability to adapt and resize based on the volume of data.

## Functionality
The application includes several functionalities:

1. Displaying the total number of registered COVID-19 cases.
2. Showing the final capacity of the dynamic array.
3. Indicating how many times the array capacity was doubled to accommodate more data.
4. Providing a search function to locate specific cases.

For testing and demonstration, a dataset with thousands of COVID-19 case records is included.

## Testing and usage
The application has undergone testing and is confirmed to be functioning as expected. Should you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to reach out.
